      "<br/>contractual basis. Since the inception of the NHM in 2005, 275,000 contractual personnel have been\n",

The majority of\n",

The methodology used is the READ approach [3],\\nwhich is a systematic approach for document analysis in health policy research, consisting of readying one's\\nmaterials, extracting the data, and analyzing it to distill the findings.

This translates to a healthcare expenditure of $2.7 per\\ncitizen per year. As a consequence, India has 0.7 public hospital beds per 100,000 people [2] now and 0.576\\nphysicians per 1,000 population in 2000 [4], compared to the World Health Organization's recommended\\ndoctor-to-population ratio of 1:1,000 [5]. Since the inception of the National Health Mission (NHM) in 2005,\\nthe government has aimed to increase the quantum of services provided, but a lack of focus on quality has\\nfailed to make a dent in healthcare indicators [6]. At best, 37% of the population had any health insurance\\ncoverage in 2018 [7].\\nThis has contributed to the for-profit private health sector becoming the dominant provider of healthcare for\\nit is perceived to provide quality care [8]. It consumes 5.1% of the GDP, which is financed by Out-Of-Pocket\\n(OOP) expenditure. This sector spans a wide range, from world-class health facilities, such as Narayana\\nHealth, an internationally accredited, high quality, tertiary healthcare service provider, to individual\\ninformal provider clinics, which are establishments providing medical care, often manned by a solo provider\\nwho does not have a formal medical qualification or registration. World-class health facilities exist in urban\\nHow to cite this article\\nSaxena S G, Godfrey T (June 11, 2023) India’s Opportunity to Address Human Resource Challenges in Healthcare.

The informal\\nproviders are concentrated in urban slums and rural areas where they are the first choice of care for they\\nhave built a long-standing trusted constant presence in their communities and have adapted to their social,\\neconomic, and cultural norms. \\n\", 6), ('Public health sector (NHM) strategies\\n', 9), ('The NHM has sought to address health challenges through five approaches - communitization, flexible\\nfinancing, improved management through capacity building, monitoring progress against standards, and\\ninnovations in human resource management [10]. Multiple new cadres have been created to provide primary\\nhealthcare and accelerate the pace toward universal health coverage. \\nA key cadre has been the female community health workers, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA), one\\nfor every 1,000 population. They number a million [11] to date and serve to increase the reach of the\\nAuxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANM), who were meant to serve a population of 5,000 but in reality, serve up to\\n20,000 people. This exercise in task shifting from ANMs to ASHAs cadre raises concerns. ANMs are high\\nschool graduates who receive 18 months of training while ASHAs attend school up to the eighth grade,\\nsometimes even less, and receive 23 days’ initial training with additional on-the-job need-based short\\ntraining [12]. ANMs are government employees and receive a salary while the ASHAs are treated as private\\ncontractors who receive a payment proportionate to the amount of work performed. A recent synthesis of\\nthe evaluation of ASHAs from a health systems perspective shows broader system constraints and\\nfew overall positive findings [12].\\nOther new cadres are being hired by the government on a contractual basis. the Rural Medical Assistants\\n(RMAs) and paramedical personnel. The RMA [13] is a three-year diploma [13,14] course similar to the\\nphysician assistant program in the US. The RMAs work at Primary Health Centers and initial\\nevaluation [15] is positive. Several paramedical councils now exist which have a number of courses varying\\nin duration from six to 24 months to train personnel for the provision of supportive care in health facilities\\nand homes. The scale of such initiatives remains nascent and systemic integration pathways remain\\nundefined. \\nWhile ASHAs remain contractors, other cadres, including doctors and nurses, are being hired on a\\ncontractual basis. Since the inception of the NHM in 2005, 275,000 contractual personnel have been\\ninducted into the workforce [16]. Doctors and nurses are incentivized to accept contractual posts in rural\\nareas by linking these postings with monetary incentives and preferential admission into residencies.\\nDoctors trained in Indian systems of medicine such as Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani (AYUSH) are trained in\\nbridge courses in allopathic medicine. Working conditions in the public sector remain demotivating [16],\\nresulting in low retention rates of these personnel and dissatisfaction levels remaining high. This is so\\nbecause contractual employees have lower remuneration as compared to their regular counterparts, salary\\npayments are delayed, and the temporary nature of contracts remains a cause of concern [17]. The poor\\ninfrastructure and supply chain issues [17] demotivate all employees. Further, the increasing incidents of\\nviolence by communities against doctors [18,19], especially during the COVID-19 pandemic  [20], add insult\\nto injury. \\nSuch system failings demotivate doctors and encourage them to seek other opportunities. The majority of\\ndoctors, (65%) [1], work in the private health sector. This share continues to grow. Others emigrate, with\\nmore than 60,000 Indian-born physicians’ now practicing in high-income countries [21]. This means about\\n10% of the physicians trained in India have left the country, making it the largest émigré physician workforce\\nin the world [21]. \\nAnother reform brought in in 2018 is “Ayushman Bharat,” a publicly financed health insurance scheme for\\nthe poor. This is designed to allow them to access primary care from health and wellness centers and avail\\nsecondary and tertiary care services from participating private health facilities [22]. The scheme has the\\npotential [23] to provide stewardship for improved governance and quality control, thereby accelerating\\nIndia’s progress toward its SDG goals. However, a recent performance evaluation [24] shows the scheme has\\nnot succeeded in improving access or providing financial protection. Similar schemes have been launched\\nindependently by various states but results, at best have been mixed [25-28]. This raises concerns about the\\nviability of publicly funded purchasing of services from private providers. \\n', 6), ('Private health sector strategies\\n', 9), ('The for-profit private health sector has perceived opportunities in this unmet demand for healthcare\\nservices [29]. It has emerged as the preferred provider of care, as patients see it as providing services that are\\nmore available and of a higher quality. This trend towards medicalization and corporatization remains\\nlargely unregulated [30] with primary care frequently eclipsed by the more expensive secondary and tertiary\\ncare [22]. During the eighties and the nineties, the private sector was largely made up of solo practitioners or\\nsmall nursing homes. Since the turn of the century, the sector has become dominated by corporate houses in\\nurban areas and is rapidly expanding to tier II and III cities. There has been a marked spike in increased\\nOOP expenditure, which accounted for 62% of total health expenditure (US$60.6 billion out of US$ 97.1\\nbillion) in 2014 [31]. This sector attracts patients from around the world, with nearly 234,000 coming into the\\ncountry in 2015, bringing an influx of $3 billion, making India the third most popular destination worldwide\\nfor medical tourism [9].\\nThe private sector has invested heavily in setting up medical colleges which have proven to be\\nprofitable.

Their fees are high, as much as 100 times those of\\ngovernment colleges, [32] and consequently, doctors graduating from these colleges are not attracted to the\\npaltry remuneration offered by contractual government posts. They gravitate towards higher remuneration\\nin the private sector, which is consequently the largest employer [1] of doctors in India. In practice, this\\nsector places constraints of a different kind. In an effort to maximize profit, the corporate sector imposes\\nperformance targets and practice constraints on doctors’ professional autonomy. A small number of\\n“star” doctors with flourishing practices can set their rules but the majority of young and early career\\ndoctors face a simultaneous erosion of their status and opportunity [33].\\n', 6), ('National Medical Council\\n', 9), ('India revamped its inept Medical Commission with a National Medical Council (NMC) in 2019 with the aim\\nof improving the regulation of health professionals (doctors and Community Health Providers) and medical\\neducation. The NMC Act remains silent about the interplay between the private corporate sector, the\\npharmaceutical industries, medical education, and healthcare services. Introducing clarity here in tandem\\nwith other reforms would ensure there is a coordinated implementation of all the inputs needed for the\\nprovision of universal health coverage. The current trend of centralizing control of medical education leaves\\nlittle leeway for states to adopt medical education to match the geographical, cultural, social, and economic\\ndiversity India represents [22].\\n', 6), ('Recommendations\\n', 9), (\"Sustain the Increase in the Budget for Healthcare\\nThe total expenditure on health in India is 3.84% of its GDP [34]. Compare this to the US with close to 18%\\ndevoted to healthcare and one-quarter of the population. The Government of India has allocated about\\n1.29% of its budget to healthcare in spite of a stated commitment in the National Health Policy 2017 to\\nincrease the allocation to 2.5% by 2025. In contrast, the Domestic General Government Health Expenditure\\nwas US 8.6%, Brazil 4%, and China's 2.9% [35]. This year the Indian government doubled its allocation to just\\nover $30 billion [36]. With just 1.29% traditionally coming from the government, the rest has come from OOP\\nexpenditures by consumers. This has resulted in many families falling into poverty every year paying for\\nhealthcare they can ill afford. The Government must increase its share of expenditure to put it further in line\\nwith other middle-income countries and its neighbors.\\nImprove Efficiency\\nThe public health system is currently unable to utilize even the 1% of the GDP that has traditionally been\\navailable to it. With a doubling of the federal government’s allocation in 2022, its capacity to do so must be\\nincreased. Increasing the financial allocation and its utilization capacity will enhance the health\\ninfrastructure and workforce capability. This requires institutional capacity building and competency-based\\ntraining in the government healthcare system [37]. This will allow the country to align its health services to\\nlocal priorities as India exhibits its diversity in its population and disease profiles. The recently started\\nNational Health Protection Mission has limited uptake The majority of Indians (up to 80.9% in urban\\nand 85.9% in rural) still do not have health insurance [38].\\nAccredit Health Facilities and in Practice Regulate the Private Health Sector\\nThe public health sector has revised standards [39] for healthcare infrastructure, personnel, equipment and\\nservices for primary, secondary and tertiary care. They need to be utilized to accredit health facilities in\\norder to achieve standardization of the health system. The private health sector is the major provider of\\nhealth care in India [40]. It consists of the entire spectrum of single provider clinics run by unqualified staff\\nto state-of-the-art hospitals. The latter provide world class care and have made India one of the major hubs\\nfor medical tourism [41,42]. However, this sector remains largely unregulated. The limited rules that exist are\\nrarely enforced. For example, these state-of-the-art corporate hospitals were allocated land in prime urban\\nlocations on the premise that a set percentage of patients from economically weaker off sections of society\\nwould receive care at little-to-no-cost. This is not often the case. The government could take steps to ensure\\nthe existing rules are implemented, and create and enforce new ones to ensure reasonable costs to patients\\nand cap the profit margins of the hospitals. The health insurance scheme for central government employees\\nin India purchases services from the private sector. This model can be expanded to scale for the population\\nusing the newly launched national health insurance scheme (Ayushman Bharat). \\nAdopt Digital Technologies at Scale\\nIn India, as in the US, digital technology is being used to facilitate its vaccination program. A digital track\\nand trace system, named eVin, has been developed to track vaccine availability and facilitate cold chain\\nmaintenance for its national immunization program. It is now enjoying widespread use to accelerate Covid-\\n19 vaccination. Online Training Management Information Systems have been indigenously developed.\\nThese systems help schedule training for new personnel, maintain records and dashboards facilitate\\nmonitoring, evaluation and policy formulation. Medical devices, mobile health apps, and wearable, trackable\\ntechnology have all enhanced opportunities for personalized care, self-management, behavior modification\\nand tele-monitoring of patients [43,44].\\nIndia should expand such application of technology to other portfolios within the health sector, as has been\\ndone by the High-Income Countries, where innovations in digital technology are supporting the delivery of\\nvital healthcare. The COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed the pace and scale of this process and enabled the\\n2023 Saxena et al. Cureus 15(6): e40274. DOI 10.7759/cureus.40274\\n3 of 6\\ndelivery of healthcare to populations who would have been denied such care otherwise. The uptake of\\ntelemedicine for consultations with healthcare providers increased 50 to 175 times in the US during the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic [45]. The scope of medical examination and procedures has expanded markedly during\\nthis pandemic. AI-embedded logarithms now diagnose COVID-19 disease from chest x-rays and CT\\nscans. Doctors can now perform an ophthalmic fundal examination online. Standards for conducting remote\\northopedic examinations are now used successfully. Drones are being used to deliver medicines to\\ncommunities [46]. A shortage of protective equipment during the pandemic was overcome by manufacturing\\nit locally using 3D printing [47].\\nIndia must close its digital divide if it is to take advantage of digital technology to aid the delivery of\\nhealthcare to the rural areas where it is needed the most. India has an internet density of 25.3% for its rural\\nareas where 66% of its population resides and an internet density of 97.9% where 34% of its population lives\\n[48]. The private health sector is taking a lead in this area, with some centers enlisting a cognitive platform\\nfor the delivery of healthcare in oncology [49], but the reach of such initiatives is very limited. Market-driven\\nforces cannot be trusted to meet the needs of an entire nation. Government must step in and direct the\\neffort. Telemedicine can amplify the reach of care, thereby helping decrease maternal and child mortality,\\nwhich are among the highest in the world in India. National policy must make this a priority. The use of\\ndigital technologies at scale can aid in the control of risk factors for non-communicable diseases such as\\nsmoking, alcohol abuse, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet [50]. There is an urgent need for this, for\\nIndia is already known as the diabetes capital of the world [51]. Increasing digital literacy can aid delivery\\nand monitoring of care for the elderly. It can ensure privacy in accessing care for those with mental health\\nissues, thereby helping overcome the stigma associated with mental health in the country [52]. But this will\\nonly happen if the central government again asserts leadership in the fight for better health for all Indians,\\nnot just those with the money to pay unassisted.\\nIndia needs to have a live register for health personnel and infrastructure. For instance, India does not have\\ndata about the exact number or geospatial details about its practicing doctors. Having accurate data about\\nthe quantity and geospatial location of its manpower will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of its\\nutilization.\\nThose trained to provide them must be well-equipped to provide the services they have been trained for.\\nLack of transparency in creating training schedules, coupled with the erratic posting of personnel, all too\\noften results in the same personnel staying at district or state headquarters, where living conditions are\\ngenerally better than in the underserved regions. Online training can help overcome this challenge. It must\\nbe adopted. This will require investment in the necessary infrastructure to do so. A two-year intermittent\\ntraining initiative for upgrading the skills of nurses was taken by faculty from the University of Nottingham\\nin India. The training received positive evaluations from participants, but few implemented what was\\nlearned due to deeper structural problems including national and state-level policies, working conditions,\\nand staff shortages [52]. Sourcing health personnel who are native residents of the communities, providing\\nongoing training in clinical and social skills, using a non-hierarchical work environment, and providing\\nindividualized mentoring help personnel retention and ensure personnel motivation [53].\\nIncreasing violence against healthcare personnel, particularly doctors is a worrisome new trend that must\\nbe met head-on. It only compounds a bad situation. A low physician-to-patient ratio not only results in\\ndelays in attending patients but adds to costs. Underpaid physicians are tempted to take on more patients\\nthan they can reasonably serve. Defensive medicine practices set in. Overwhelmed physicians protect\\nthemselves by ordering unnecessary tests and procedures. The profit motive of the private sector forces\\nmandatory advance payments [54]. Unethical practices by pharmaceutical companies  [54] and an intense\\nfocus on specialization [55] abet these issues, tempting providers to refer unnecessarily and prescribe\\ntreatments [55] that may not be needed to assure patients that their concerns are being\\naddressed. Physicians get entangled in a complex web. Dissatisfied, patients may strike out at a system that\\nis failing them. As physicians, seen as authorities, are in direct contact with their patients, they are most\\naccessible and tend to bear the brunt of agitated and frustrated patients and their families. Until and unless\\nphysicians, particularly primary care physicians, are adequately compensated, this trend is likely to continue\\nwith the consequences noted earlier. The private marketplace will not be able to solve this. Only a thoughtful\\napproach to government planning can reverse the situation.\\n\", 6), ('Conclusions\\nThe aims, strategy, structure, and service provision by the public and the private health sector are different,\\nand the recommendations made here are an effort to synergize their services for maximizing efficiencies at\\nscale.
